Exp Site 1 — Lennart Hilbring

Getting started

1. Preview locally:

Python 3:

cd "/Users/olihilbring/Desktop/FH Dortmund/HTML :: CSS Kurs WISE2526/html/Exp Site 1"
python3 -m http.server 8000

Open http://localhost:8000

2. What this scaffold includes:
- index.html — brutalist starter shell with hero, sidebar, and work tiles
- styles.css — brutalist token set and responsive layout
- main.js — GSAP-powered kinetic type and lazy loader for demo (injects Three.js)

3. Next steps I can take for you:
- Implement Hero Option A (full WebGL hero with masked transitions)
- Build case-study template and add 1 sample case
- Wire contact form to Formspree or serverless endpoint

Tell me which to do next and I will continue building.
